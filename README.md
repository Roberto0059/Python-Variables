<h1> Python-Variables Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Variables help security analysts to keep track of a variety of security-related information. For example, analysts may need to create Python variables for the users who are allowed to log in, the number of login attempts that they're permitted, and the current number of attempts that a user has made.

In this lab, you'll practice assigning values to variables and determining their data types.
