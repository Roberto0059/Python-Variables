<h1> Python-Variables Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data.
Variables help security analysts to keep track of a variety of security-related information. For example, analysts may need to create Python variables for the users who are allowed to log in, the number of login attempts that they're permitted, and the current number of attempts that a user has made.

In this lab, you'll practice assigning values to variables and determining their data types.

1. In your work as an analyst, imagine there is a device only users specified on an allow list can access, and its device ID is "72e08x0". In the following code cell, assign this value to a variable named device_id. Then, display the contents of the variable and observe the output. <br/>

2. Now, imagine that you've been informed that the previous list is not up-to-date and that there is another employee that now has access to the device. You're given the updated list of usernames with access, including the new employee, as follows: "madebowa", "jnguyen", "tbecker", "nhersh", "redwards", and "lpope". In this task, reassign the variable username_list to the new list. Run the code to display the list before and after it's been updated to observe the difference. <br/>
